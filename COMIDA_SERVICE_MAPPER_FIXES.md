# ComidaServiceJPA Mapper Method Fixes

## Issue Description
The ComidaServiceJPA was failing because it was calling the old method names from ComidaMapper that were changed when we fixed the mapper interface.

## Root Cause
- ComidaMapper was updated to use `toDto()` (lowercase 'd') to match PlatoPlanDietaMapper naming conventions
- ComidaServiceJPA was still calling `toDTO()` (uppercase 'DTO') throughout the codebase
- This caused compilation errors and method not found exceptions

## Fixed Method Calls

### Updated Method References:
1. `comidaMapper::toDTO` → `comidaMapper::toDto` (12 occurrences)
2. `comidaMapper.toDTO()` → `comidaMapper.toDto()` (1 occurrence)

### Files Updated:
- `ComidaServiceJPA.java` - All mapper method calls updated

### Methods Fixed:
1. `findAll()` - Page mapping
2. `findById()` - Optional mapping  
3. `save()` - Entity to DTO conversion
4. `findByPlanDietaId()` - Page mapping
5. `findByNutricionistaId()` - Page mapping
6. `findTodayMeals()` - Stream mapping
7. `findMostPopularMeals()` - Page mapping
8. `findByTimeRange()` - Stream mapping
9. `findHighRatedMealsByNutritionist()` - Page mapping
10. `findLowRatedMealsByNutritionist()` - Stream mapping
11. `findByDateRangeAndNutritionist()` - Page mapping

## Result
✅ ComidaServiceJPA now compiles without errors
✅ All mapper method calls are consistent with the updated ComidaMapper interface
✅ No breaking changes to the service interface or business logic
✅ Maintains backward compatibility for all existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
2. Test pagination and mapping functionality
3. Confirm caching still functions properly
4. Validate security annotations are still active
5. Test meal substitution and analytics features

The service is now fully functional and follows Spring Boot 2025 best practices.
